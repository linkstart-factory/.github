### Why are we here?

This is a place to play around, practice, and turn any idea into code.
Is our small community but with no limitations, no rules, just the will to build cool software.
We should be able to trust everyone here so it will be a closed organization.

I will put some ideas and start some projects here, you are welcome to make a pull request when you want.
At the same time, I owe you to create new repos and projects, for us to collaborate and build cool stuff that you can monetize later.

Please feel free to add new ideas to this list:
- Soffas: A group of AI agents that will work together like a team to help us, making the shitty part of software development for us.
