### Why are we here?

This is a place to play around, practice, and turn any idea into code.
Is our small community but with no limitations, no rules, just the will to build cool software.
We should be able to trust everyone here so it will be a closed organization.

I will put some ideas and start some projects here, you are welcome to make a pull request when you want.
At the same time, I owe you to create new repos and projects, for us to collaborate and build cool stuff that you can monetize later.

### Please feel free to add new ideas to this list:
- [Soffas](https://github.com/linkstart-factory/soffas): A group of AI agents that will work together like a team to help us, making the shitty part of software development for us.
- [kees4.dev](https://github.com/linkstart-factory/keyss): This will be a SaaS that will help development teams to save, share, and export their ".env" files.
- maekit: Platform to see companies' hiring interests. The goal is to showcase the technologies that companies demand from those who want to apply for their different positions and/or areas, in order to motivate potential new talents to follow the necessary path to get their dream job.
